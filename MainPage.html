            <h2>Red Light- Green Light</h2>
            <p>The red light green light game will be a typing test that will turn the back of the screen different
                colors based on when the user should type. This game will be used to improve a users ability to not look
                at the keyboard while typing. The game mode will have a set amount of characters in order to get
                equalized highscores and will follow the basic rules of red light green light. If the screen is green
                then the user can type the given paragraph as fast as possible. The screen will then turn yellow to warn
                users that they need to stop typing and if they do not stop they will automatically loose and be forced
                to try again. Users highscores will be based on how fast they can complete the task and will only count
                when the screen is green.

                <h2>Random characters</h2>
                <p>The random characters game will be used to help users learn the locations of rarely used keys and odd
                    key combinations on the keyboard. A randomly generated string of ASCII values will be generated for
                    the user to type, and the accuracy of typing will be evaluated.

                    <h2>Time Test!</h2>
                    <p>Timed testing will be used to improve user’s ability to type fast. This will be random paragraphs
                        and
                        will be focused on the users WPM. If the user messes up on any character than the cursor will
                        not
                        move forward and will stay on the last correct character.

                        <h2>Type Fighter</h2>
                        <p>Type fighter will be a game mode where the user has monsters to “fight” by typing words
                            correctly
                            to improve typing accuracy. When the user makes a mistake in their typing, health is
                            subtracted
                            from the user’s overall health. The goal is to defeat as many monsters as possible without
                            dying
                            and get to a boss. The boss will need to be defeated by typing more difficult strings
                            without
                            making mistakes. After the user defeats the boss, their wpm and accuracy will be added to
                            the
                            user’s account and, if appropriate, the leaderboard for the game.
